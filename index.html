		<h4>
			Introduction / History, Philosophy, & Religion
		</h4>
		<p>
			The introduction explained each chapter throughout the book, but also pointed out the progression of the view of Americans in China throughout time. The second chapter explains their history by giving explanations of the major wars and rebellions in China, the major philosophies of Confucianism and Daoism, and the major religions of Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. So far, China has been surprising me with the different aspects of life that are just so different from life in America and getting to know their history has definitely helped in giving me an understanding in where it all comes from. It was very interesting to see how American's can be seen with, but they are still friendly and welcoming to the point where the people will take pictures of any caucasian they see. I love the learning more baout China's history just because there is so much application in their daily life that roots from it, and I only look forward to learning more!

		<h4>
			Culture / Economy
		</h4>
		<p>
			This chapter on culture explains the struggles of a foreign business person and how different the way of conducting business is to a foreigner in China. Many traditional Chinese cultural practices leave foreigners asking, "Why?" and being more familiar with it will definitely be a large obstacle. The chapter on economy suggests that China's economic growth is on a rapid climb and is only a matter of time before it reaches the size of America's. The life in China has improved because of it for it's natives and for foreigners. In my personal experience, business is happening everyday and life here is just so busy. The opportunities for businesses are endless as there is just so much consumption occurring throughout the day. With my experience with the culture, there are certain aspects that are not too hard to pick up. However, there are a few times where I found myself reverting to my western mindset, such as: not receiving something with two hands, pointing my chopsticks straight down, or making facial expression when trying new foods, but overall I think the culture is not too hard to pick up as it seems very similar to how my household is ran.

		<h4>
			The Consumer Market / Marketing Strategies
		</h4>
		<p>
			The chapter on the consumer market elaborates that the huge population in China does not necessarily mean the consumer market only consists of the native Chinese people, but is so diverse! The chapter on marketing suggests that a company cannot go into business in China with a western mindset, but redesign their image due to the mass amount of symbolism in their culture, not to mention the amount of censorship in China as well. For example, when going into a McDonalds, I observed the menu to be commpletely different. In America, deals for getting a massive amount of chicken nuggest are glorified, but in China, the most chicken nuggets I saw that you could buy at once is 5...5!?! It was hard to get use to, but I just had to learn to accept it. Below, you will see the burger I bought because I couldn't buy 20 chicken nuggets at once.

		<h4>
			Sourcing in China / Business Structures
		</h4>
		<p>
			The chapter on sourcing in China explained why many foreign companies would look to China when wanting to cut down the costs of production because it is low cost, low risk, and simple. These are all reasons as to why the Dalian High-Tech Industrial Hub is constantly growing in interest for foreign companies that want to outsource. The chapter on Business Structures explains how to start a business in China. After starting a business, one must think about the different official reports that they must supply for their business, such as accounting documents and other preparations for running a business. Currently, from analyzing the way my "friend's workplace" is ran, business seems to be less regulated than in America, but at the same time have different regulations such as not being able to work and live at the same place.

		<h4> 
			Staffing & Employment / Business Etiquette
		</h4>
		<p>
			The chapter on employment in China highlighted that there are many opportunities for English speakers to obtain jobs in China, especially in studying or teaching. From what I have noticed so far, most of the expatriates that I have met here in China are usually here for work. The chapter on business etiquette talked about avoiding awkward or embarrassing acts in a business setting. It introduced a term "faux pas" which means doing or saying something embarrassing in a social setting and thankyfully, I have not done or said any such things so far. The image below shows a jazz singer from Detroit that was hired by a jazz club called "1515 West" in Shanghai to perform for the night.

		<h4>
			Negotiation / Daily Life
		</h4>
		<p>
			The chapter on negotiation highlighted that when making negotiations, both parties intend to create a win-win situation in which both parties benefit from the deal. This would be hard for a westerner to implement because most come to China with a mindset that they can obtain a product for the cheapest price possible without taking into consideration that the vendor still needs to make a profit. This mindset is always what causes me to raise the price I am willing to pay for something in China, or I'm just terrible at haggling. In the chapter of daily life, I am focusing on the food in China, as it is my favorite aspect of China. As someone that does not eat vegetables, I've found it very easy to get around China with only eating meat as all I need to do is point to a picture of a bowl of meat and say, "Mei Fan" and I'll be eating a meal that resembles something that my mom would cook back home. Below, is an image of a lunch at my "friend's workplace" that consisted of some dishes and dumplings... so... many... dumplings...
